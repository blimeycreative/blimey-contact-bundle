Savvy Contact Bundle
====

This bundle has been created as the source code for the ["Writing a Symfony2 Contact bundle" tutorials][1] by Savvy Tech.

Feel free to check out the tutorial and follow along here:

* [Tutorial 1][1]
* [Tutorial 2][2]
* [Tutorial 3][3]
* [Tutorial 4][4]

The tutorial is reasonably basic as is the contact form but it does work through many Symfony2 features including:
* The command line tool for bundles, entities, forms and CRUD's
* Working with entity and form classes
* Annotations
* Services.yml and simple parameter setup
* Translations
* Simple twig templating
